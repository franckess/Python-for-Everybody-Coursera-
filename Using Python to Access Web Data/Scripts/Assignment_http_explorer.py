### Assignment: Exploring the HyperText Transport Protocol

# You are to retrieve the following document using the HTTP protocol in a way that you can examine the HTTP Response headers.

# http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/intro-short.txt
# There are three ways that you might retrieve this web page and look at the response headers:
# 
# Preferred: Modify the socket1.py program to retrieve the above URL and print out the headers and data.
# Open the URL in a web browser with a developer console or FireBug and manually examine the headers that are returned.
# Use the telnet program as shown in lecture to retrieve the headers and content.

while True:

    if ( len(data) < 1 ) :
