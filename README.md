Python for Everybody Coursera (July 2016)

## Description
This Specialization introduces fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. 
In the Capstone Project, I use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create my own applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.
